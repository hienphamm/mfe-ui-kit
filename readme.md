# UI Kit
This is a collection of reusable UI components designed to be used across different micro-frontend applications. The components are built using Stencil, which allows them to be framework-agnostic, meaning they can be used in React, Vue, Angular, and other frameworks.
# Installation
To install the UI Kit, you can use npm or yarn. Run one of the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
npm i mfe-ui-kit
# or
yarn add mfe-ui-kit
```
